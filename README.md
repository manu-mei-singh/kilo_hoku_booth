Kilo Hoku Photo Booth (Star Watching Photo Booth), A rift off pose net/ML 5 photobooth 

Steps to reproduce ( a little help from/for my friends)

There are two files. An index html file and a P5.js file

the p5.js is an ML (machine learning) PoseNet file turned into a a photobooth application (hit "a" to take a photo)

the Original PoseNet file: 
https://github.com/ml5js/ml5-examples/tree/master/p5js/PoseNet/PoseNet_webcam

How to make this work:

1. Download both files. 
2. Make sure both files are in the same folder*
3. Open the index.html file in a browser (make sure you have a wifi connection)
4. The model should load and you should start seeing white dots on people.
5. At this point you can turn off the wifi if you so wish (Mahalo Keahi!)
6. Pose in front of the laptop/cam 
7. Hit the "letter" a to take a screenshot -- the photo will be downloaded into your downloads. 

**Make sure you have a camera attached to your computer/laptop for usage**

Setting up the photobooth: 

1. get as dark a room as possible.
2. Get a black wall (fabric or paint -- Mahalo Olin!)
3. Find an ideal distance (Mahalo Albert!)

_If the room is dark enough and people are on a black wall, you should mostly see the skeleton and points from PoseNet neural network_

Have a Blast!
